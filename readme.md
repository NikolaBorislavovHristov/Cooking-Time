Cooking Time

# Projec for Telerik Academy
#### You are hungry? And you can cook?
#### but you are not sure what?

Use my application to find the perfect recipe for you! You can watch the daily pick videos, full with fresh ideas or you can browse in my database and find your next meal idea. 
Add recipes to your grocery list, write your notes and go to the market for the products. Check your shopping list if you think you are forgetting something, and don’t worry about the wifi in the supermarket, because you don’t need it. If the recipe is in your grocery list you can check it any time ;)
Have a nice meal. It’s cooking time!
